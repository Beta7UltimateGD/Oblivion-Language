Yep, another new programming language baby!
This language is to explain and convert code into Geometry Dash triggers. (kinda like SPWN) It uses the SPWN compiler. Still
on development ;-;

Keywords:
if

execute

import

def

exp

level

#include

console.log

print(

printf(

java.util

It also runs on C++, C, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript. Also, type the code in your notepad app. Enjoy!
